## details

* build with [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) version 3.0 beta. Check their page for more details.
* this example is using Vuex for application state management, to learn more about it I recommend [checking their docs](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/).
* you can look under the hood directly from your browser using [vue devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools). Install extension for your browser, open demo page (link above) and see how app state changes when you interact with it.
